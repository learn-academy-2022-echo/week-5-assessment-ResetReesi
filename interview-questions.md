1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer:

From my understanding a ruby hash is a collection of key value pairs placed in an array, not just any array but an array that does not have a number index. Ruby hashes have an index but is recognized by the key value pairs of any object in ruby. As we all know and heard "EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT ON RUBY!"

 When I think of a gem I like to think of a crystal red gem given to me as a gift from. A ruby gem is another package managment tool for a developer that makes life 100% easier. Ruby gems keep tarck of all the software I load into my computer, It upgrades all the software on my computer, It also also creates me a server for me to  run my software on.



Your answer:

Researched answer:
After doing a little bit of research I figureg out the main reason why ruby gems are important. Ruby gems are designed to take away your headache. Why would you reinvent a whole new app from scratch when we have ruby with all our package managment tools built in. I know that ruby also has a testing phase to help create more efficent code.Ruby takes care of the files you are uploading, helps with authorization and authe ntication. No need to worry ruby takes care of all that for us developers.



3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer:

Ruby on rails is basically everything you need to be an amazing developer. It has everything you need to build a full-stack framework. Its an all in one exspense paid trip if you aske me. It provides everything you need to build a font end and back end application. I remember in class we made a txt based game in ruby and I thoight that was so unique.


Researched answer:

Reasearch goes into more of the perks of using ruby and rails. Ruby and rails is really just Ruby written in a ceratin way. They coinside with each other. They are like family members. There are some differences that I think are important to know. For example evrything is ruby is an object. Ruby on rails is mainly uses to biuld web application and use server side scripting which means designing websites that processes a user request. This will send the request to the home server and return the data the usere requested. It's also used to develop interface scripts which leps on the fron end of things.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: 

A relational database is always made up of rows and colums and they hold all of our data in tables. A relational data base to me is just a template for the same data per user. Relational data bases serves as a template because it allows our users to see the same data. The user may be different , but the template that the users see stays the same. Its basically a straight forward model to represent the data that being passed inside the tables. So, yes there are several other types of data bases. We have database structure which we also call a Schema and its just a way to build blocks of a database.

  

Researched answer:

During my research I found that relational database has principles that should be followed meaning all items in a cloumn must have the same type of information for each user. In each column that you create it must have the same amount of rows and tables. Everything has to sync and look as if the format workd for everyone. for example when you go to instagram every post looks the same. It has a user name, a picture than a story of choice. Every instagram user has the same structure but the information for each user will be different. By using this format it will help identify each row because each user will have it own primary key. Finding out that there are alot more databases then I thought was pretty cool. I did not know that there was a non relational database and thet there are 4 types of non relational databases. what this data base is basically a database used for a huge amount of data. For example twiiter,facebook and other big companies that have millions of users use this type of data base. It's mainly used because it usually performs at a fatser level since there are not alot og tables to sort from in order to deliver what your looking for.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer:
A primary key is a like a house key. Its a unigue key for every record in the the data base. A primary key is personalized id. When you think of a primary key think of your telephone number. You are the only perosn with the telephone number that you have. no on else can have the same number as you. Your id can also be a unique identifier, No on has that exact id. Its meant for just you. How to identify you. They even help make up a relational data base. They are important because it is a way to help you keep track of data and access the data quick and easy.

Researched answer:

Research shows that without Primary keys are inmportant because thet make up the relational database. Relational data bases are inportant because they take care of our users. Primary keys help build a relationship between two tables and this is helps create a relational data base. A primary key can be written in a single column or a combine set of columns. Primary keys are very useful in the aspect that thry help you avoid inserting the record twice. You are also able to to update and delete a specific record by calling on there primary key. The primary key will help you access data 123.
